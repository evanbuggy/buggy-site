I'm Evan Buggy, a student at the University of Limerick currently in my 3rd year of computer science for game development. Video games, game development, modding, homebrew and programming in general keep me busy in my free time, as well as making an incessant amount of tea.

Many aspects of game development pique my interest; things such as 2D art and spritework, 3D modelling, animation, writing, gameplay design and theory, programming and more. But as most developers do, on this website, you will probably find me discussing these things more than actually doing them.

Blog posts will primarily be for whatever is on my mind, but generally speaking there will be a lot of pieces of me talking about the games I play and various aspects about them. The gallery is reserved for either embarassing old art I did when I was younger, or (hopefully) some newer, nicer looking pieces and showcases of my work as a developer. Or maybe even a photo every now and then if I'm feeling exotic.
