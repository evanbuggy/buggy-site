This gif has a neat little history. This is actually my very first 3D model. I made it in Sketchup at the age of 13 and used it in a Super Mario 64 ROM Hack. I have a video (albeit a very poor quality one) showcasing it [here](https://youtu.be/i5Jf3Kym7oY?si=2LhH8N6O1nN1CX3B). One day as I was digging up some old files, I found it again and decided to "recycle" it. By messing around with a bunch of settings in the Eevee renderer, I was able to create this cool looking effect that makes it look straight out of a Super FX game. I think I will repeat this process for some of my other level models or find some other ways to make them look cool!
