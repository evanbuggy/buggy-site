# buggy-site

This is my statically generated portfolio website. It uses Hugo and a Console theme by [Marcin Mierzejewski](https://mrmierzejewski.com/). See a demo of the theme [here](https://mrmierzejewski.com/hugo-theme-console/).

The deployment uses GitHub Actions and the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. As of now, there is no domain associated with the site so you can visit it at [https://evanbuggy.github.io/buggy-site/](https://evanbuggy.github.io/buggy-site/).
