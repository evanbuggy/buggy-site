      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Evan Buggy, a student at the University of Limerick currently in my 3rd year of computer science for game development. Video games, game development, modding, homebrew and programming in general keep me busy in my free time, as well as making an incessant amount of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many aspects of game development pique my interest; things such as 2D art and spritework, 3D modelling, animation, writing, gameplay design and theory, programming and more. But as most developers do, on this website, you will probably find me discussing these things more than actually doing them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This animation was made as a proof of concept for an old point and click game I used to work on when I was younger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe this is the last piece I ever made that was something to post on social media. Most of what I do and draw now is meant for larger projects, or just concept art and doodles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is concept art I made for a character from a point and click game I developed when I was younger. She is meant to characterise an internet browser.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Typically when I do character design, the first thing I do is write down aspects and traits of their personality to help me visualise them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very old drawing of mine, from when I was 15. One of the few ones I am still proud of from way back when. As of writing this, I am 21 and chapter 3 is still not out&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
